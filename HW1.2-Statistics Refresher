Content :
After the success of the Rosetta mission, ESA decided to send a spaceship to rendezvous with the comet THX1138.
This spacecraft consists of four independent subsystems A, B, C, D. Each subsystem has a probability of failing
during the journey equal to 1/3.
1) What is the probability of the spacecraft S to be in working condition (i.e., all subsystems are operational at the
same time) at the rendezvous?
2) Given that the spacecraft S is not operating properly, compute analytically the probability that only subsystem
A has failed.
3) Instead of computing the probability analytically, do a simple simulation experiment and compare the result to
the previous solution. Include a snippet of your code.
4) An improved spacecraft version has been designed. The new spacecraft fails if the critical subsystem A fails, or
any two subsystems of the remaining B, C, D fail. What is the probability that only subsystem A has failed, given
that the spacecraft S is failing?
